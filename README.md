A tiny terminal personality that reacts, talks, and lives inside your app.

ASKIIMON is a lightweight JavaScript library that gives your CLI or app a living ASCII companion. It shows emotions, reacts to events, and displays messages in real-time.

## Concept

ASKIIMON is designed to feel like a small creature living inside your terminal.
It reacts to user actions, shows emotion, and adds personality to otherwise plain output.

---

## Use Cases

* CLI tools with personality
* Developer utilities
* Debugging assistants
* Interactive scripts
* Terminal experiments

---

## Note

ASKIIMON is meant to be expressive and customizable.
You control how it behaves and how it communicates.

---

## Philosophy

Most tools just print text.
ASKIIMON reacts.

---

Actively being developed. Expect improvements and new features over time.
